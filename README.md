## Project Overview

ACME Hospital Out of Network Notification Project is a comprehensive solution designed to address compliance with the ‚ÄúCures Act‚Äù Information Blocking Rule. Leveraging Microsoft Power Platform, the application ensures efficient patient data management, real-time notifications, and seamless integration with Microsoft services.

## Key Components

### Infrastructure

The project relies on Microsoft Power Platform, a cloud-based service offering scalability and reliability. Key components include:
- **Scalability:** Cloud-based infrastructure, model-driven architecture, and integration capabilities facilitate scalability.
- **Reliability:** Global data centers of Microsoft ensure high availability and low latency, guaranteeing consistent performance.

### Architecture

Deeply rooted in Microsoft Power Platform, the architecture highlights:
- **PowerApps:** The application utilizes PowerApps, fetching data from a SharePoint list for benefits in data consistency and seamless integration with other Microsoft services.
- **Integration:** PowerApps seamlessly connects with services like SharePoint and Power Automate, ensuring efficient data flow between components.
- **Data Flow:** A well-defined path from CSV data source through Power Automate to SharePoint entries, demonstrating efficient and structured data management.

### Security

Azure contributes significantly to data security:
- **Data Security:** Encryption protocols for data in transit and at rest, multi-layered security, and continuous monitoring protect patient information.
- **Compliance:** Adherence to industry standards like GDPR and HIPAA ensures regulatory compliance.
