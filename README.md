## Project Overview

ACME Hospital Out of Network Notification Project is a comprehensive solution designed to address compliance with the ‚ÄúCures Act‚Äù Information Blocking Rule. Leveraging Microsoft Power Platform, the application ensures efficient patient data management, real-time notifications, and seamless integration with Microsoft services.

## Key Components

### Infrastructure

The project relies on Microsoft Power Platform, a cloud-based service offering scalability and reliability. Key components include:
- **Scalability:** Cloud-based infrastructure, model-driven architecture, and integration capabilities facilitate scalability.
- **Reliability:** Global data centers of Microsoft ensure high availability and low latency, guaranteeing consistent performance.

### Architecture

Deeply rooted in Microsoft Power Platform, the architecture highlights:
- **PowerApps:** The application utilizes PowerApps, fetching data from a SharePoint list for benefits in data consistency and seamless integration with other Microsoft services.
- **Integration:** PowerApps seamlessly connects with services like SharePoint and Power Automate, ensuring efficient data flow between components.
- **Data Flow:** A well-defined path from CSV data source through Power Automate to SharePoint entries, demonstrating efficient and structured data management.

### Security

Azure contributes significantly to data security:
- **Data Security:** Encryption protocols for data in transit and at rest, multi-layered security, and continuous monitoring protect patient information.
- **Compliance:** Adherence to industry standards like GDPR and HIPAA ensures regulatory compliance.

## Technical Details

### Database Design DFD

- **Entities:** Health Information Exchange, ACME Hospital (SFTP), Power Automate, Power Apps, Physicians.
- **Datastores:** CSV File, SharePoint List.
- **Processes:** Sending CSV to ACME SFTP, Storing CSV, Power Automate Conversion Flow, Power Automate Notification Flow, etc.
- **Data Flow:** ACME hospital receives CSV from HIE, Power Automate converts and notifies PowerApps, Physicians access patient information.

### Working Prototype Storyboard/Wireframe - UX/UI/HCI Design

- **Login Page:** User authentication and password recovery.
- **Authentication Screen with MFA:** Multi-Factor Authentication for enhanced security.
- **Home Page:** Navigation to patient list, notifications, and search functionalities.
